At the heart of the system is the guideway - a 9.4 mile bus exclusive road between downtown New Britain and downtown Hartford. <br><br>Local route 101 runs on the guideway every 7-8 minutes during peak hours, every 12 minutes in the midday and Saturday, and every 20 minutes at night and on Sunday. This high service frequency shuttle is at the core of the service plan, but many other routes provide connections to and from origins and destinations off the guideway.<br> <br>Schedule available here: http://www.cttransit.com/RoutesSchedules/CTfastrak.asp<br>For more information, visit ctfastrak.com (http://www.ctfastrak.com)<br><br><img src="http://ctfastrak.com/media/rokgallery/a/a59363fd-3620-4f34-e845-912a9aa6414b/414f7480-e8b2-45e0-f073-3a690004521e.jpg" height="200" width="auto" /><br><br><img src="http://ctfastrak.com/media/rokgallery/9/9325c06c-362f-44ed-975c-a13f8e0a3bed/e187c3fa-c579-4222-916f-323e7379ded5.jpg" height="200" width="auto" /><br><br><img src="https://scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/10689920_718312431551351_7024890918128662416_n.jpg?oh=789e830f3223117460e994eefde238c5&oe=54B4286B" height="200" width="auto" />]]></description>
